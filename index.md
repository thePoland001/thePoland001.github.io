# About 

Hi, I'm Josh – a BSISE engineering candidate at UAH, MSCS candidate at CU Boulder (pursuing concurrently with my bachelors), and an incoming SWE Intern at Parry Labs. My passion for learning has led me to explore many different fields such as data science, machine learning, robotics, MBSE, aeronautical & astronautical engineering, and even the non technical domains of finance & real estate investing. Outisde of working and studying, I like to read, write, draw, and play chess. 

I'm graduating from UAH & CU Boulder in 2026 (in May and December respectively), and I plan to work as a software engineer in the defense tech industry - ideally with a focus on data science or GNC. Below are some projects that I completed recently. 

# Projects 
Conflict-driven Clause Learning SAT Solver
- Python implementation of a modern CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) SAT solver with VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum) decision heuristic and phase saving

Enhancing Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning 
- Developed a neural network model with hyperparameter tuning using TensorFlow and Keras to classify cancer diagnoses with PCA and SMOTE for improved feature selection and class balancing
- Achieved high predictive accuracy (99%+) through model optimization, oversampling, and feature reduction, enhancing diagnostic reliability

ALEXNET Deep Learning Model
- Developed a deep learning model using AlexNet to classify images, achieving a high accuracy rate through data preprocessing, label assignment, and performance evaluation with a confusion matrix
  
Chess Engine Using Mini-max Algorithm  
- Basic chess engine used to determine the best move on a chess board with a depth of 3  
- More project information can be found here: https://github.com/thePoland001/ChessEngine

Numerical Solution of Oblique Shocks  
- Developed a python code that utilizes the bisection and secants methods to determine the Mach number and thermodynamic variables upstream and downstream of oblique shock waves

Numerical Solution of Expansion Waves 
- Developed a python simulation to determine the Mach number and thermodynamic conditions of a Prandtl–Meyer expansion through an expansion angle
  
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Solution of Quasi-1D Nozzle  
- Developed a CFD code to solve for the subsonic-supersonic isentropic flow through an arbitrary convergent-divergent nozzle using MacCormack’s Predictor Corrector Technique
