# CDCL SAT Solver
A Python implementation of a modern CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) SAT solver with VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum) decision heuristic and phase saving.
 
# Features

✨ CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning)

📊 VSIDS scoring for intelligent variable selection

🔄 Phase saving for better search efficiency

⚡ Non-chronological backtracking

🔍 Unit propagation

📝 Detailed debugging output

# Installation
No external dependencies required. Simply clone the repository:

```consol
git clone https://github.com/thePoland001/cdcl-sat-solver.git
cd cdcl-sat-solver
```

# Basic Usage

```python
from sat_solver import CDCLSolver

# Create a new solver instance
solver = CDCLSolver()

# Add clauses (each clause is a list of integers)
# Positive numbers represent positive literals (x₁)
# Negative numbers represent negative literals (¬x₁)
solver.add_clause([1, 2])    # x₁ ∨ x₂
solver.add_clause([-1, 3])   # ¬x₁ ∨ x₃
solver.add_clause([-2, -3])  # ¬x₂ ∨ ¬x₃

# Solve the formula
is_sat, assignment = solver.solve()

if is_sat:
    print("Formula is satisfiable!")
    print("Solution:", assignment)
else:
    print("Formula is unsatisfiable!")
```
